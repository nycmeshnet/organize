If you want to join our network, fill out [[this form.]] Please be patient. Due to the volume of our requests, it might take a while to get back to you. 

In part, this is due to the [[difficulty]] and [[cost]] of connecting points that are more than a few blocks from the next point. By getting your neighbors in your building [[nycmesh.net/leaflet]], on your block [[nycmesh.net/community/ flier]], or [[at your organization]] interested, it becomes significantly cheaper for everyone. We can help you [[mesh]] with your neighbors, sharing internet access in a secure and reliable way. Check our [[map]] to see if somebody near you already has a node. We are consistently adding [[services]] to our network, including a [[data center in Lower Manhattan.]] Check out our [[resources]] page to get started in your neighborhood!
    
If you’re a developer or organizer, you can find us  on [[github]], [[slack]], and [[email]]. You can also check out our documentation [[here]].
