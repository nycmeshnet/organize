From Nitin:
So I set my computer in Amazon cloud, that tunnels to HE IPv6 Internet
connected to Brian's node. That is our gateway to IPv6 Internet in the
future. Right now its only an IPv4 Tunnel, but may be we can set up an
IPv6 Tunnel in the future, so all nodes can get out to v6 Internet
from my server.

Creating Tinc Tunnel between mesh node gateways to Brian's Tinc node
here! Routing Mesh Node traffic between Islands to be covered later.

I am detailing out the process of how we create clients here :

Steps:
a. Install TINC.
b. Create directories and conf files
    mkdir -p /etc/tinc/<name>
    vi /etc/tinc/<name>/tinc.conf

    add below to tinc.conf above. serverev is the East Village server
to connect to.

    Name = <name>
    AddressFamily = ipv4
    Device=/dev/net/tun
    ConnectTo = serverev

c. Create public/private keys for <name> , public key will be stored
on /etc/tinc/<name>/hosts/<name>
    tincd -n <name> -K

d. Add "Subnet=192.168.112.x" to the top of the file on
/etc/tinc/<name>/hosts/<name> , so far .1 is used for EV and .10 is
used for IPv6 gateway. We need to keep a record of this.

e. Add the following contents on two files, tinc-up and tinc-down , on
/etc/tinc/<name> folder.

tinc-up : change /bin/bash to /bin/sh if a mesh node. also change
192.168.112.x to your IP.

#!/bin/bash
ifconfig $INTERFACE 192.168.112.x netmask 255.255.255.0

tinc-down

#!/bin/bash
ifconfig $INTERFACE down

f. chmod these two files.

chmod 755 /etc/tinc/myvpn/tinc-*

g. Now copy the /etc/tinc/<name>/hosts/<name> public key file to
wherever we want to Peer. e.g. in this case, we copy the
hosts/serverev file to this client and this client's hosts/<name> file
to Brian's EV server, tinc hosts directory.

h. Run Tinc  -- change to /tmp/log/tinc.log if you are on a mesh node.

    tincd -n v6gw --logfile=/var/log/tinc.log


Then you should be able to ping the tunnel from EV mesh node as below.

root@Mn-EV-3rdSt-N750-3f00:/etc/tinc/serverev/hosts# ping 192.168.112.10
PING 192.168.112.10 (192.168.112.10): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 192.168.112.10: seq=0 ttl=255 time=19.706 ms
64 bytes from 192.168.112.10: seq=1 ttl=255 time=51.698 ms

Tunnel IPs 10.11.12.1 and 10.11.12.2
https://10.11.12.2

 The current tunnel is between Brian’s router- 10.30.75.1  and Nitin’s http://10.63.326.1
