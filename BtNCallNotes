Ilda Simao | Internet Society, Geneva was the host for the call

Call began with introductions from each grant recipient. SF, Kazakhstan, Paraguay etc. All very interesting. Everyone spoke English very well, which was surprising.

Half of the funding will be wired next week. The second half in the middle of the year (this is flexible).

There will be an award letter and the grants will be announced on the ISOC website next week.

Two written reports must be made. One in the middle of the year and one at the end. It will contain a narrative and a financial part.

There will be a 1 to 1 call in September about the project.

There is flexibility in the timeline. We just need to tell ISOC of any project changes.

Budget changes due to less than full funding should be submitted using the template

We should do a video of describing the project, or a blog post.

Another video at the end of the project.
