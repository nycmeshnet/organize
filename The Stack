Hardware
Stable/Legacy:
More info at nycmesh.net/download

In testing:
Add github.com/nycmeshnet/nycmeshfeed to your build for these devices. Binaries on the way. Email firmware@nycmesh.net to get involved.
Dual-band
TP-Link are locked until probably 2017
ZBT-APE522ii see M2M below
2.4 indoor
TP-Link discontinued our 842ND, the 841 has poor OpenWrt support and very little memory
GL-AR150 -- Charlie is testing for indoor replacement/low power option. Possibly usable with 5Ghz usb wifi dongle in addition to on-board 2.4. 
In alpha testing Need to add TINC
GL-300M -- Same as above, but being tested by @rgreen
Directional 802.11ac
This would be great for connecting to kiosks. NSM5 gets 60Mb, could probably double that with 802.11ac
P2P
Testing AF 2.4, Donated 24Ghz, Ligo. Cruzio and Google use Siklo.
P2M
Testing Prism to NanoBeamAC  getting around 80Mb over 2 km
LigoWave dlb 5-90
M2M
ZBT-APE522ii  Is it possible to buy less than 100? Hard to believe it is dual and ac.
They said they ship us 2 for $45 a piece--for testing. $37 at 100.
