So, we have spent the last 4 years developing software, a routing protocol, and a hardware stack that is flexible, cheap, and plug and play. All of our software is open-source. Thus far, we've relied on donated bandwidth from individuals to serve our free and open network. This has been made possible through the volunteer efforts of hundreds of engineers, designers, programmers, and users. We have teams working concurrently in Toronto, Oakland, Montreal, Spain, Germany, and India to share and extend free wireless internet.

We have already been donated server space, of plenty IXP-level fiber connections, and some of the best access on the East Coast. We are 1 hop from Google's servers, 2 from Facebook, and will be hosting caching servers for both Wikipedia and Netflix within the month. All access to our network is free. All connections can scale as quickly as we need it to.

We have line of sight to 3 million people, all of whom hate their ISP. The only thing stopping us from growing is hardware.

What I need from you:

We're hosting meetings with the world's largest internet providers, talking to the world's largest content distributors, and staring down the face of a giant, empty market. We want to provide free and open access to the residents of New York City, and everyone from the Mayor's office, to the libraries, to the churches are excited. Our donation model has already bought us a data center. Let's see how far it can go.

Let us test your hardware in some of the most densely-populated spectrum on the planet. If your devices can truly deliver what they say they can, I'll need 100 more by January and a 1000 more next year. I would like that first one to be free. I know I'm asking a lot, but I know y'all can deliver. List price would be tax-deductible through our fiscal sponsor, The Internet Society. If I can prove to the city it works (like you say it does), then we'll be set to cover 2 million of New York City's residents without access to broadband at market rate for your devices. Ubiquiti already gave me two Air Fibers to play with. Will you prove to me your product is better?
